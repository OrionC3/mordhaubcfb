**EVENTS**

*Nobles*

**How nobles work :
- Manual player selection by moderator or admin
OR
- Activation by a VIP

Nobles will be released or locked by admins

If locked up: As soon as nobles are released, FFA is activated EVERYWHERE
If free: FFA is activated EVERYWHERE
If nobles against rest of players = FFA deactivated and allowed only against nobles

Event announced by an admin: 
1) x nobles against rest of players
2) Nobles locked up and released following an action
3) Protect nobles
4) Destroy ramparts and kill nobles

*PARKOUR*

The admins will make some elements appear, and you'll have to climb them. If you fall, you'll have to start all over again.
The first person to complete the parkour wins an in-game reward (to be defined).
It's forbidden to kill other players doing the parkour (even if they're in the FFA zone).
Using game bugs is forbidden and will be penalized (kick or ban).

*TEAM DEATMATCH*

If the server is in team deathmatch mode, it's possible for admins to create events:
- gunfire
- each one its gun
- protect your noble (2 nobles in each team, and the first team to kill the other noble wins (verified by an admin).
